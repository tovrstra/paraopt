# Paraopt

Paraopt is a simple parallel optimization toolbox.

This code was mainly written to make myself more familiar with the inner workings of the CMA algorithm. It may be useful for anyone interested in learning how it works. It is not guaranteed to be the best or most efficient CMA implementation. It is kept simple though.
