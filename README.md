# Paraopt

Paraopt is a simple parallel optimization toolbox.

This code was mainly written to make myself more familiar with the inner workings of the CMA-ES algorithm. It may be useful for anyone interested in learning how it works. It is not guaranteed to be the best or most efficient CMA-ES implementation. It is kept simple though.

More information about CMA-ES can be found here: https://github.com/CMA-ES
